## About

Flickster is a web app that allows you to browse and save your favorite movies from various streaming providers. Whether you are looking for a comedy, a thriller, or a romance, Flickster can help you find the perfect movie for your mood and taste.

With Flickster, you can:

- Search for movies by title, genre, year, or rating
- View detailed information about each movie, such as synopsis, cast, trailer, and ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes
- See where you can watch each movie across multiple streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, and more
- Save movies to your personal watchlist and access them anytime
- Share your movie recommendations with your friends via social media or email

Flickster is built with the following technologies:

Flickster is a final course project on a university discipline called "Web Technology and Web Design". It was created by [seesmof](https://github.com/seesmof), a passionate movie lover and aspiring web developer.

I hope you enjoy using Flickster as much as I enjoyed creating it. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to contact me or open an issue on GitHub. Thank you!
